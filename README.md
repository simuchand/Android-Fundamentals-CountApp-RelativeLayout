# Android-Fundamentals-CountApp-RelativeLayout

## Introduction

A simple UI based android application.Layout consits of TextViews and basic Buttons elements. The application follows a "Relative Layout".
In this ***CountApp***, here there is a separate TextView to keep track the previous total count before the re-set button was clicked. (Note: The design anf function is similar to the linear layout, only the layout is changed)
